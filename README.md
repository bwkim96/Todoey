# Todoey App Clone

My version of a Todoey App - a simple iOS to-do list app. [Original version](https://github.com/appbrewery/Todoey-Realm-iOS13-Completed)

## Usage
To use, install [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org/) and run

```bash
pods install
```
to install the necessary pods.

## Details

Used [Realm](https://github.com/realm/realm-cocoa) to persist data.
Used [SwipeCellKit](https://github.com/SwipeCellKit/SwipeCellKit) for the swipe action.
Used [Chameleon](https://github.com/wowansm/Chameleon/tree/swift5) for colours.
